### Project Requirements:
1. Language and Framework of Choice:

 * HTML-5 and CSS are delivered by PHP Version 7.3
 * Javascript is used for the photo slideshow on the gallery page
 * Vagrant/Packer is used for building and automating the building of the servers
 * Apache 2.4.18 (Ubuntu) webserver hosts HTML, PHP, Javascript, and CSS
 * Redis 5.0.3 is used as in-memory data structure store and allows for faster searching and to cache data from the web server
 * MariaDB Server 10.0.38 provides a SQL interface for accessing data

 2. Operating System Platform:

   a. Linux - Ubuntu 16.04.5

   b. Process of secrets management: gitignore, openSSL, SSH key, HashiCorp Vault

  * Gitignore - The gitignore file was created for the purpose of preventing files from being uploaded without needing to explicitly exclude them. Any file added to gitignore is not included in git commits. Using gitignore allows system-specific files to be untouched, and it ensures that those sensitive files will never get uploaded.</p>

  ![gitignore](images/gitignore.png "Gitignore")

  * OpenSSL - Purpose of using openSSL is to keep the sending and receiving traffic safe and secure between the server and clients without the possibility of the messages being intercepted by outside parties.</p>

  * SSH Key - To automate secure access to the servers, bypassing the need to manually enter log-in credentials. The SSH key provides strong, encrypted verification and communication between the user and a remote computer. RSA keys are used to verify users before allowing the cloning of our private repository into the remote servers.</p>

  * SHA1-hash - We used SHA-1 with salt to hash our passwords

  ![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Jz3a8jO92crUlWM/giphy.gif)

  * Privileges - Unregistered users cannot view photos; Admins have the ability to view and create new users

  * HashiCorp Vault - Vault by HashiCorp is a tool for securely managing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log. We plan to incorporate HashiCorp Vault to secure SQL databases and RSA Keys in the next and final sprint.

  ![vault](images/hashicorp.png "Vault")  

  ![vault2](images/vault.png "Vault")

  c. Capture of application metrics:

  * We used Prometheus as a tool to capture application metrics. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that collects metrics from our services and stores it in a time-series database. Prometheus provides a basic web interface for monitoring the status os itself and its exporters, executing queries, and generating graphs.

  ![prometheus](images/prometheus.png "Prometheus")

  * In order to integrate with complex data from Prometheus, we have used a tool called Grafana which is a completely open-source tool for data visualization and a monitoring system that collects metrics from our services. Grafana has a feature-rich metrics dashboard and graph editor for Prometheus and it also allows to query, create alerts, notifications, and ad-hoc filters for our service, which we might incorporate in the next sprint.

  ![grafana](images/grafana.png "Grafana")

  * To expand Prometheus beyond capturing metrics about itself only, we have installed an additional exporter called Node Exporter. Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter that provides detailed information about the system, including CPU, disk, and memory usage. It will expose the webserver's metrics through Prometheus.

  ![node_exporter](images/node_exporter.png "Node Exporter")
    
    

 3. Use of Data Store:

 * We are using 2 database servers (Platform: MariaDB/MySQL)
 * One of the database servers serves as the master which we write to. One of the uses of this database is that it is the one that is manipulated by our application. All writes are done to this database. This means that all user information and photos are written to this database.
 * The other database server serves as the slave and is the database which we read from. User information and photos are transferred from the master database to this database using a replication process. Our application uses this database to pull information and photos.
 * One Redis Cache Server is used for caching the data, which is sent between the slave database and web server. Redis is a NoSQL key-value data store. For storing a value, we associate it with a key and store it in Redis. The purpose of using Redis caching is to improve database loading performance.

4. Data Encryption at Rest:

 * Encrypted using a symmetric cipher provided by OpenSSL. Password fields are encrypted using SHA1-hash with salt (salt concatenates random data with the hash)
 * MariaDB 10.1 has Data at Rest Encryption and is fully supported for XtraDB and InnoDB.
  * XtraDB: A storage engine for the MariaDB
  * InnoDB: A storage engine for the database management system MySQL.
  * MariaDB allow our files to encrypt:
    - All tablespaces
    - Individual tables
    - Uses a 32-bit integer as a key identifier.
    - Encryption keys can also be rotated, which basically creates a new version of the encryption key. Decryption is also readable through Maria’s file server keys.


5. Use of MySQL/MariaDB Database Master-Slave Replication:

 * Database Schema:
 ![schema](images/schema.png "Schema")
 * 2-Database Servers running MySQL/MariaDB - 1 server serves as a master server and another serves as a slave. Master and slave servers are connected.
 * The purpose of using the master-slave replication process is to enable data from one MySQL database server (serving as 'the master') to be copied automatically to another MySQL database server (which serves as 'the slave').
 * The master-slave replication is a one-way replication (from master to slave); the master database is used only for the write operations, while the slave database is only used for reading operations.
 ![databaseslave](images/databaseslave.png "Database Slave")
 * During designing or deploying the application, all the write operations (statement/query that changes the state of the database) are executed ONLY on the master server. As to minimize the risk of data conflicts on the slave, changes can only be made through the replication process.
 * 1 Apache web server hosts HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS
 * 1 Redis Cache server

 <p>Our setup uses the Apache server for providing the UI (our website) to the end user; information from the registration page and users uploading photos are written to the master database server. The master is connected to a slave server, which holds a copy of the database used for reads. Writes and reads are separated to minimize the required movement of the disk head. On the master database, separating write from read frees up resources to focus on writes only and minimize the movement of the head by writing a few queries in a sequence and only moving the head once every few writes, in order to move the data into the “heap” (permanent storage in the database). On the slave database, reducing its functions to primarily reads allows it to handle more queries by freeing resources for the job.</p>
 <p>A Redis Cache server is placed between our Web server and Slave Database server and is responsible for storing a portion of the database entries and allows for faster searching and queries entered on the web server.)</p>


6. Responsive Design (In-progress):

<p> Responsive Web Design is in progress. The overall goal is to make the website scale and adapt to multiple form factors and screen sizes, such as when using a smartphone or tablet. We have added media queries into the css file (style.css) based on expected screen sizes. We have also added styling to reposition, resize and hide elements. There is no framework being specifically utilized for responsive design, as the framework currently being used is Font Awesome, and queries are stored in a css styles page. Will be experimenting and looking into a framework called W3.CSS as this framework has built-in responsiveness, supports responsive mobile-first design by default, equality for all devices and browsers, as well as being simpler and faster.</p>
Mobile media queries commit: https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2019-team-06f/commit/f01aa997eb2ae30e1bb8594390a03c961755285a#diff-c13367945d5d4c91047b3b50234aa7ab <br/>

![mobileabout](images/mobileabout.png "MobileAbout")
![mobile](images/mobile.png "Mobile")


7. Use of HTTPS:

 <p>The entire website has left HTTP behind and switched to HTTPS. The “S” in HTTPS stands for “Secure”. It’s the secure version of the standard “hypertext transfer protocol” your web browser uses when communicating with websites. It is important for our application to run on HTTPS to gain the trust of our users. We have generated a self-signed certificate. The certificate is issued by Team True at the Illinois Institute of Technology and is good for one year.</p>
  
 ![https](images/https.png "HTTPS 1")

 ![https2](images/https2.png "HTTPS 2")

 ![https3](images/https3.png "HTTPS 3")

 * Firewall:

   - Using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) in Apache 2:
   - Ideally, we want to limit the number of ports open and only want to use which we need. This is a list of open ports and our current firewall setup.
 
 ![ufw](images/ufw.png "Uncomplicated Firewall Rules")

 * Authentication keys (if applicable)
 * Seeding of username and passwords as well as pre-seeding databases with schema and records are done on build using packer build scripts.

 8. Use of User Authentication:

 **Unauthenticated users access:**
 * Have access to “read-only” data
 * Restricted features until account created (cannot view the gallery or have any access to photos without an account)

 **Authenticated normal users have access to:**
 * Upload photos
 * View own photos
 * Search for photos (hashtags)
 * View recent uploads
 ![user](images/user.png "user") 

 **Administrator Access:**
 * Custom made admin panel
 * Able to create accounts (admin or user)
 * Able to view all accounts
 * Able to delete users
 ![admin](images/admin.png "Admin")
 ![adminadd](images/admin_panel_add1.png "Adminadding")
 ![adminadd2](images/admin_panel_add2.png "Adminadding2")
 ![admin2](images/admin2.png "Admin 2")

9. Creation of Dev Environment:

 <p> We have created the webserver, database master and slave, as well as the cache server using Packer. All of our servers are currently deployable. </p>

 ![devenv](images/devenv.png "Dev Environment")


 ![serverdiag](images/serverdiag.png "Server Diagram")

 We are able to deploy all 4 servers using Packer build. Any issues or bugs during deployment or issues with UI/UX are reported using Github Issues. These Github Issues are then further assigned as tasks to the appropriate team members to fix.

11. Management of Visio Diagram:

 <p>Diagrams are managed on a weekly basis, with continual updates by the UI/UX leader and Project Manager. Two tools that we are using to create diagrams are LucidChart and Draw.io.</p>

 ![lucidchart](images/lucidchart.png "Lucidchart")
 ![draw](images/draw.io.png "Draw")

12. Management of project progress:

 <p> All the communication and update processes for this project are done through Slack. We have integrated Github on Slack so that commits are shown immediately in order to update the team on any changes made. We are keeping track of our to-do, in-progress and done tasks through Trello. Upon the completion of a task, the person assigned to that task moves the card to the done section. We are keeping in contact throughout the duration of the sprint via Slack to update each other on accomplishments/issues.</p>

 13. Test Users:
 <p> Fifteen test users were generated, and the data is being inserted into our MariaDB databases at build. New users can be added or deleted from the database thereafter. For said purpose, ‘.sql’ files are being used with the insert command to add values into the username, user_type, email and password fields. Fifteen images are being inserted for each user. </p>

**Any issues/Bugs?**
Two bugs previously opened are now closed and the two following bugs have been found.
1. The delete user page is unable to delete users that have uploaded pictures due to a foreign key constraint.
2. The current version of MariaDB that we are running doesn't have file key management, which is necessary for database encryption. 


**Goals for Next Sprint:**
- Implementing responsive web design using CSS media queries in order to fit multiple form factors, such as mobile and tablet
- Data Encryption at Rest using XtraDB and InnoDB
- Data Encryption for Data in transit
- Incorporating HashiCorp Vault for data encryption and to secure SQL databases and RSA Keys
- Moving Prometheus into a new server


#### Individual Reflections:

**Daniel** - I worked on implementing mobile queries which have been tested to work on IPhone 6,7,8; 6,7,8 Plus and Iphone X as well as IPad. While there is more to be desired the CSS queries are resizing and presenting our UI in a usable manner. Also I was able to resolve few bugs, one of which was our searchbar not functioning properly after a search has been executed and another search performed from the searchresults.php page. Upload picture as well as some other php functionality was also affected by the searchbar and those issues were resolved. I also had to deploy another Github key to rebuild the current configuration after the move of the code into Code folder. I was able to succesfully use our website from my Iphone 7 Plus and upload a photo of my own. Overall our team was able to accomplish a lot of our goals and has done considerable progress on others which are still in progress.

**Sarina** - This sprint, I spent some time researching css media queries and making edits related to css responsive design. Also due to changes from last sprint, I spent some time rebuilding my servers. Also, as changes were made to interface of our site, I created updated diagrams for the user panel, admin panel and made sure the repository was up to date with those. I also contributed in the creation and editing of this report scraping trello and github for artifacts. 

**Jason** - This sprint is covering the final stretches of the overall project, with one sprint to go. The team has accomplished alot so far, with this sprint comprised primarly of fixing any issues/bugs, organizing and cleaning things up, as well as focusing on the user experience. As Project manager, I helped to manage trello and the report, as well as recording a demo to demonstrate functionality of our website to be shown in class, learning whatever I can about the components of the website. For the final sprint, we hope to implement something challenging for a final sendoff of this project. 

**Shan** - As promised with database encryption, I attempted to work on encrypting the database but found out that the current version of MariaDB we have does not have encryption at rest. Only versions grearer than 0. do so in order to do that we would have to change our whole infrastructure. I am trying to see if someway we can manaully add the encryption files into the current version so that it can work. I worked on devloping the admin page with a delete feature where super users can now remove accounts with JS script. I hope to plan database encryption by the next sprint if possible since we only have a couple weeks left now. 

**Hasan** - In this sprint, I feel like we improved the application and fixed a lot of existing issues. I started off this sprint by fixing the variables-sample.json which was filed as having a bug. After that, I worked on moving everything into a code folder and changing the appropriate paths. I worked with Shan on getting data encryption at rest. However, we ran into an issue which is that our version of MariaDB does not support database encryption. We will need to overhaul the database for database encryption. We will work on that in the next sprint. For the next sprint, we plan implement something very special. Overall, we met and exceeded our expectations this sprint.     

**Bhumi** - This sprint I have contributed with documenting the report including GitHub urls and trello accomplished goals. Also, I have tried to search the resources for my own understanding of hashiCorp Vault and how it works. At this stage, our team has accomplished most of the goals and working on the challenges for the upcoming sprint.
