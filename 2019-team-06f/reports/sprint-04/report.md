### Project Requirements:
1. Language and Framework of Choice:

 * HTML-5 and CSS are delivered by PHP Version 7.3
 * Javascript is used for the photo slideshow on the gallery page
 * Vagrant/Packer is used for building and automating the building of the servers
 * Apache 2.4.18 (Ubuntu) webserver hosts HTML, PHP, Javascript, and CSS
 * Redis 5.0.3 is used as in-memory data structure store and allows for faster searching and to cache data from the web server
 * MariaDB Server 10.0.38 provides an SQL interface for accessing data
 2. Operating System Platform:

   a. Linux - Ubuntu 16.04.5

   b. Process of secrets management: gitignore, openSSL, SSH key, HashiCorp Vault

  * Gitignore - The gitignore file was created for the purpose of preventing files from being uploaded without needing to explicitly exclude them. Any file added to gitignore is not included in git commits. Using gitignore allows system-specific files to be untouched, and it ensures that those sensitive files will never get uploaded.</p>

  ![gitignore](images/gitignore.png "Gitignore")

  * OpenSSL - Purpose of using openSSL is to keep the sending and receiving traffic safe and secure between the server and clients without the possibility of the messages being intercepted by outside parties.</p>

  *  SSH Key - To automate secure access to the servers, bypassing the need to manually enter log-in credentials. The SSH key provides strong, encrypted verification and communication between the user and a remote computer. RSA keys are used to verify users before allowing the cloning of our private repository into the remote servers.</p>

  * SHA1-hash - We used SHA-1 with salt to hash our passwords

  ![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Jz3a8jO92crUlWM/giphy.gif)

  * Privileges - Unregistered users cannot view photos; Admins have the ability to view and create new users

  * HashiCorp Vault - Vault by HashiCorp is a tool for securely managing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log. We plan to incorporate HashiCorp Vault to secure SQL databases and RSA Keys in the next sprint.

  ![vault](images/hashicorp.png "Vault")     

  c. Capture of application metrics:

  * We used Prometheus as a tool to capture application metrics. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that collects metrics from our services and stores in a time-series database. Prometheus provides a basic web interface for monitoring the status os itself and its exporters, executing queries, and generating graphs.

  ![prometheus](images/prometheus.png "Prometheus")

  * In order to integrate with complex data from Prometheus, we have used a tool called Grafana which is completely an open-source tool for data visualization and a monitoring system that collects metrics from our services. Grafana has feature rich metrics dashboard and graph editor for Prometheus and it also allows to query, create alerts, notifications, and ad-hoc filters for our service which we might incorporate in the future sprint.

  ![grafana](images/grafana.png "Grafana")

  * To expand Prometheus beyond capturing metrics about itself only, we have installed an additional exporter called Node Exporter. Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter that provides detailed information about the system, including CPU, disk, and memory usage. It will expose the webserver's metrics through Prometheus.

  ![node_exporter](images/node_exporter.png "Node Exporter")
    
    

 3. Use of Data Store:

 * We are using 2 database servers (Platform: MariaDB/MySQL)
 * One of the database servers serves as the master which we write to. One of the uses of this database is that it is the one that is manipulated by our application. All writes are done to this database. This means that all user information and photos are written to this database.
 * The other database server serves as the slave and is the database which we read from. User information and photos are transferred from the master database to this database using a replication process. Our application uses this database to pull information and photos.
 * One Redis Cache Server is used for caching the data, which is sent between the slave database and web server. Redis is a NoSQL key-value data store. For storing a value, we associate it with a key and store it in Redis. The purpose of using Redis caching is to improve database loading performance.

4. Data Encryption at Rest:

 * Encrypted using a symmetric cipher provided by OpenSSL. Password fields are encrypted using SHA1-hash with salt (salt concatenates random data with the hash)
 * MariaDB 10.0.38 has Data at Rest Encryption and is fully supported for XtraDB and InnoDB.
  * XtraDB: A storage engine for the MariaDB
  * InnoDB: A storage engine for the database management system MySQL.
  * MariaDB allow our files to encrypt:
    - All tablespaces
    - Individual tables
    - Uses a 32-bit integer as a key identifier.
    - Encryption keys can also be rotated, which basically creates a new version of the encryption key. Decryption is also readable through Maria’s file server keys.


5. Use of MySQL/MariaDB Database Master-Slave Replication:

 * Database Schema:
 ![schema](images/schema.png "Schema")
 * 2-Database Servers running MySQL/MariaDB - 1 server serves as a master server and another serves as a slave. Master and slave servers are connected.
 * The purpose of using the master-slave replication process is to enable data from one MySQL database server (serving as 'the master') to be copied automatically to another MySQL database server (which serves as 'the slave').
 * The master-slave replication is a one-way replication (from master to slave); the master database is used only for the write operations, while the slave database is only used for reading operations.
 ![databaseslave](images/databaseslave.png "Database Slave")
 * During designing or deploying the application, all the write operations (statement/query that changes the state of the database) are executed ONLY on the master server. As to minimize the risk of data conflicts on the slave, changes can only be made through the replication process.
 * 1 Apache web server hosts HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS
 * 1 Redis Cache server

 <p>Our setup uses the Apache server for providing the UI (our website) to the end user; information from the registration page and users uploading photos are written to the master database server. The master is connected to a slave server, which holds a copy of the database used for reads. Writes and reads are separated to minimize the required movement of the disk head. On the master database, separating write from read frees up resources to focus on writes only and minimize the movement of the head by writing a few queries in a sequence and only moving the head once every few writes, in order to move the data into the “heap” (permanent storage in the database). On the slave database, reducing its functions to primarily reads allows it to handle more queries by freeing resources for the job.</p>
 <p>A Redis Cache server is placed between our Web server and Slave Database server and is responsible for storing a portion of the database entries and allows for faster searching and queries entered on the web server.)</p>
6. Responsive Design (In-progress):

<p> Responsive Web Design is in progress. The overall goal is to make the website scale and adapt to multiple form factors and screen sizes, such as when using a smartphone or tablet. We have added media queries into the css file (style.css) based on expected screen sizes. We have also added styling to reposition, resize and hide elements. There is no framework being specifically utilized for responsive design, as the framework currently being used is Font Awesome, and queries are stored in a css styles page. Will be experimenting and looking into a framework called W3.CSS as this framework has built-in responsiveness, supports responsive mobile-first design by default, equality for all devices and browsers, as well as being simpler and faster.</p>

![mobile](images/mobile.png "Mobile")


7. Use of HTTPS:

 <p>The entire website has left HTTP behind and switched to HTTPS. The “S” in HTTPS stands for “Secure”. It’s the secure version of the standard “hypertext transfer protocol” your web browser uses when communicating with websites. It is important for our application to run on HTTPS to gain the trust of our users. We have generated a self-signed certificate. The certificate is issued by Team True at the Illinois Institute of Technology and is good for one year.</p>
  
 ![https](images/https.png "HTTPS 1")

 ![https2](images/https2.png "HTTPS 2")

 ![https3](images/https3.png "HTTPS 3")

 * Firewall
   - Using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) in Apache 2:
   - Ideally, we want to limit the number of ports open and only want to use which we need. This is a list of open ports and our current firewall setup.
 
 ![ufw](images/ufw.png "Uncomplicated Firewall Rules")

 * Authentication keys (if applicable)
 * Seeding of username and passwords as well as pre-seeding databases with schema and records is done on build using packer build scripts.

 8. Use of User Authentication:

 **Unauthenticated users access:**
 * Have access to “read-only” data
 * Restricted features until account created (cannot view gallery or have any access to photos without an account)

 **Authenticated normal users have access to:**
 * Upload photos
 * View own photos
 * Search for photos (hashtags)
 ![user](images/user.png "user") 

 **Administrator Access:**
 * Custom made admin panel
 * Able to create accounts (admin or user)
 * Able to view all accounts
 ![admin](images/admin.png "Admin")
 ![adminadd](images/admin_panel_add1.png "Adminadding")
 ![adminadd2](images/admin_panel_add2.png "Adminadding2")
 ![admin2](images/admin2.png "Admin 2")

9. Creation of Dev Environment:

 <p> We have created the webserver, database master and slave, as well as the cache server using Packer. All of our servers are currently deployable. </p>

 ![devenv](images/devenv.png "Dev Environment")


 ![serverdiag](images/serverdiag.png "Server Diagram")

 We are able to deploy all 4 servers using Packer build. Any issues or bugs during deployment or issues with UI/UX are reported using Github Issues. These Github Issues are then further assigned as tasks to the appropriate team members to fix.

11. Management of Visio Diagram:

 <p>Diagrams are managed on a weekly basis, with continual updates by the UI/UX leader and Project Manager. Two tools that we are using to create diagrams are LucidChart and Draw.io.</p>

 ![lucidchart](images/lucidchart.png "Lucidchart")
 ![draw](images/draw.io.png "Draw")

12. Management of project progress:

 <p> All the communication and update processes for this project are done through Slack. We have integrated Github on Slack so that commits are shown immediately in order to update the team on any changes made. We are keeping track of our to-do, in-progress and done tasks through Trello. Upon the completion of a task, the person assigned to that task moves the card to the done section. We are keeping in contact throughout the duration of the sprint via Slack to update each other on accomplishments/issues.</p>

**Any issues/Bugs?**
- Upload photo php is affected by the search-box php and if search box is included in upload.php the upload feature ceases to work. Currently the issue's cause is unknown and the search box has been removed from upload.php to ensure functionality for the time being.

- In the variables-sample.json we have an entry for database-user-name but in the post-install scripts we have that value hard coded as worker.


**Goals for Next Sprint:**
- Implementing responsive web design using CSS media queries in order to fit multiple form factors, such as mobile and tablet
- Data Encryption at Rest using XtraDB and InnoDB
- Data Encryption for Data in transit
- Incorporating HashiCorp Vault for data encryption and to secure SQL databases and RSA Keys
- Cleaning up code and putting everything in a code folder
- Resolve the upload.php bug
- Resolve the variables-sample.json bug



#### Individual Reflections:

**Daniel** - In this sprint, as a Junior Developer, I managed to add more functionality to our website by implementing few key features to it. First, I was able to tie up each upload to the specific userid in the users table from which the upload was done, this allowed us to display only photos that this particular user has uploaded to them. Users also have the ability to view the last 10 uploaded pictures by all users by using the recently uploaded pictures feature. Second I redesigned the Search-box and made it functional to search photos by hashtag. The search is currently using a wildcard approach %hashtag% to include results which are part of larger hashtags, and a more refined Advanced search feature with its own dedicated button/site will be implemented allowing the user to search photos by date uploaded or the name of the photo. The photo name is currently manually entered by the user at upload, but we plan to implement php GET to auto grab the value from the file name and input it instead of manual input. Implementing those new features created some css interference and some of the css needed to be redone to fix the issues. I've also worked on mobile first queries, but it's certainly not done and I plan on continuing work on it for the next sprint.

**Sarina** - This sprint as IT Operations I did some studying about responsive design and made some css contributions to responsive design by building upon what my teammates Daniel and Jason had started, I helped to manage our trello board by archiving cards and moving tasks around as I appropriate, I updated our diagrams for site functionality to add new changes noted by professor this sprint (I ended up have to do this twice because I missed some vital features). Also I assisted with the creation of this report. This sprint our team has made some crucial progress and our sight is coming full circle.

**Jason** - This sprint, the team has come full circle, with just some cleaning up and tweaking left to do. I have mainly been focusing on responsive design, experimenting and hopefully trying to implement a framework. I contributed to the report and tried to fix and clean up whatever could be addressed. The team has made a lot of progress, with future sprints just cleaning up, tweaking, and finalizing the project, mainly focusing on the user experience.

**Shan** - I primarily focused on researching more about data encryption at rest using HashiCorp Vault technology. I carefully looked over some tutorials that were on the internet, but I am still having trouble fully understanding the concept behind. Encryption data at rest requires to generate a key management and encryption plugin. This is where it will encrypt data at rest and decrypt as well. MariaDB has three methods to do encryption at rest:

  * File Key Management Plugin
  * AWS Key Management Plugin
  * eperi Gateway for Databases

The plugin is there but the key that is used to decrypt is on the server which raises a concern for data security. Even if I were to use AWS key management, the credentials will be viewable since it is on the cloud. The file key management plugin would be where the key is generated through and stored. None of these plugins are that effective to prevent from data being leaked. I even thought of the idea of having the credentials stored on a cloud file storage, but it would be the same thing as having AWS doing our encryption work.

I could have the keys stored under HashiCorp so that secret management comes into play, but since I have never touch those security tools it will take me some time to learn it. The reason why we don't have encryption at rest today because I wanted to look into some solutions on how to secure the key properly. I'm also learning how HashiCorp works and that will be used on our backend as well for quick automation.

Besides the research being done on this, I worked with Hasan on testing the Prometheus application metrics. I sent out a DDOS attack using Kali Linux penetration tools to see if our metrics is working properly. After hitting our main server, we were able to see an increase of our data metrics which we wanted to see.

**Hasan** - For this sprint I worked primarily on the capture on application metrics. I was able to install node_exporter, prometheus, and grafana on the web server. For the next sprint I plan to move the capture of application metrics to a seperate server. Also, I plan to work on incorporating the Hashicorp Vault and improve the css of our webpage. I think in this sprint we challenged ourselves to try different things and will try to improve our infrastructure and application in the future sprints.       

**Bhumi** - During this sprint as a Project Manager, I worked with group members to keep up with the sprint updates. I helped hasan and Daniel by inserting the “image names” in the database for the searching the pictures for the search bar. For the demo of this sprint, I gained the information about the functioning of Prometheus, Node Exporter and Grafana with the help of Hasan. Along with teammates I have also contributed to document the requirements of the report. For this sprint we have accomplished most of the goals that we set in the beginning of this sprint-4. At this point our TruHawk website servers the main purpose of photo sharing and uploading images using the hashtags and users can also search the images using search tags. It was a good experience to be the Project Manager and coordinate with the team mates and achieve the goals successfully that were being set for this sprint.
